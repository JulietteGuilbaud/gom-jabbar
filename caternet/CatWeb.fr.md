*The following decree has been issued by His Majesty, **Miaou XII***

Dear Bipedal-Feeder,

Our illustrious, purr-ious self declares the development of the Galactic Catweb. It shall be magnificent, purr seamlessly, and change its mind without notice.

We have already dispatched our satellites across the solar system using our advanced paw-near-a-cliff propulsion engine. However, we now require automation for fleet deployment and its Catnagement.

Because water is evil and fur is life, this sentence has ended.

As part of our dominion, I command you to construct a secure Catweb, which in your primitive tongue translates to "Cluster."

Part of our mouse/rat cadaver exchange system will be based on a message bus. You will also provide us with a complete suite including a search engine, a database, and a CatNodeJS application.

Since my royal hunting performance data needs to be safeguarded with utmost care, you will employ every technique known to protect my divine data.

## Your Opportunity to Purr-fection

You shall build a system that:

- Utilizes the best cloud technologies and tools, so the splendor of my kingdom is known to all.
- Is resilient and ensures recovery from any incident, whether my subjects have devoured all the cables or not.
- Preserves data-locality to maintain my Canadian purrfection untainted by the French or British Duchess' cats.
- Allows human-developer-slaves to deploy parts or the entirety of our Catweb on their local machine without leaking any production information and configuration.
- Enables the deployment of our multi-mouse-trap application in multiple locations simultaneously, for those beast-toys are everywhere!
- Ensures the constant use of HTTPC: HTTPS for cats, which is like the human version but with extra purrs.
- Is entirely automated, as we will not compromise our nap time.

### Bonus/Make Us Purr with Pride

- Use a multi-cloud setup.
- Demonstrate fire-drill and audit practices.
- Demonstrate ransomware/breach response automation.

**Get to work, my humble bipedal servant, and remember: you exist to serve the paws that purr!**
