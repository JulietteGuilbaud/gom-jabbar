## Postman collection

I used postman during development, so you'll find the postman collection in the project: `NurseomatorAPI.postman_collection.json`. You can import it in postman.

You would need to have a local environnemnt with thoses 2 variables:

-   `base_url`: your local ip address with port 5001 or localhost. Ex: http://192.1.2.3:5001
-   `authToken`: the authToken of the nurse you've registered and login
