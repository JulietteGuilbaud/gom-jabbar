# Journey to the Great North

Nurses are the unsung heroes, braving all conditions to provide care where it's needed most. Recently, the International Association of Nurse Explorers (IANE) has embarked on a mission to provide healthcare to the remote communities of the Great North. It's cold, it's wild, and it's full of majestic moose and mysteries.

## The Nurse's Quest

As part of this noble (and somewhat frosty) mission, your task is to develop a comprehensive system to support nurses in their journey and ensure they can deliver top-notch healthcare in the most remote and challenging environments. Don't forget your thermal underwear!

## Objectives

To support our brave, big-coat-wearing nurses, we need to develop the following features:

### API Development

- **Location Reporting**:
  - Allow nurses to report their current location and status, preferably before their mustaches freeze solid.
  - Enable real-time tracking of nurse movements to ensure they don’t get lost among the polar bears.

- **Supply Management**:
  - Track the inventory of medical supplies and equipment, including extra-large needles that won't snap in the cold.
  - Signal when supplies are running low and need restocking—because nobody wants to run out of hot cocoa.

- **Patient Records**:
  - Securely store and retrieve patient medical records, protected from both hackers and curious penguins.
  - Ensure all records are encrypted and only accessible by authorized personnel, and maybe one very smart seal.

### Mobile Application

- **Interactive Map**:
  - Display a map of the Great North with the current location of nurses and igloos... er, healthcare facilities.
  - Highlight areas where medical assistance is urgently needed, like the Yeti's cave or Santa’s workshop.

- **Emergency Alerts**:
  - Allow nurses to send emergency alerts with their location to the central command, especially if they encounter any rogue snowmen.
  - Enable real-time notifications for critical updates and alerts, like impending blizzards or moose traffic jams.

- **Resource Management**:
  - Provide an interface for nurses to manage their supplies and request additional resources, such as more marshmallows for their hot cocoa.
  - Allow tracking of supply usage and restocking, especially important for keeping track of how many mittens have been lost.

- **Patient Interaction**:
  - Enable secure communication with patients via text and video, even if the patient's WiFi is powered by sled dogs.
  - Facilitate remote consultations and follow-ups, ideally without the patient being distracted by a passing narwhal.

### Security Measures

- Ensure that all communications and data exchanges are encrypted, not just by ice.
- Implement multi-factor authentication for accessing sensitive information, possibly including a handshake with a snowman.
- Regularly audit and monitor the system for potential security breaches, like a penguin trying to hack in.

### Bonus/Optional

- Develop a feature to ensure that individual nurses' movements cannot be tracked beyond necessary operational needs, unless they’re being followed by an enthusiastic walrus.
- Implement a system to securely store patient interactions and consultation records, accessible only by involved parties and maybe a very trustworthy polar bear.
- Create a feature for managing and tracking the mental health and well-being of nurses during their mission, including alerts for when they need a hot drink and a warm blanket.

We look forward to seeing how you can help our nurses conquer the challenges of the Great North with innovative, secure, and slightly absurd solutions!
