# Welcome, Future Tech Star!

Hello, candidate!

We're thrilled that you've been chosen to tackle our technical challenge and that you're excited to dive in!

## The Principle
This challenge is your chance to shine and showcase your unique talents.

You do ***NOT*** need to:

- **Complete everything**: Unless you're feeling unstoppable and have the time, ***one*** project is more than enough for us to have a fascinating chat about your approach and code 💡.
- **Finish the project entirely**: You decide what's sufficient to demonstrate your skills—code, documentation, tests, configuration, etc. 🏋️‍♀️.
- **Stick to our exact stack**: Whether you know Node, Rust, or React/Svelte, that's great! But if you're a Python or Haskell guru and can wow us with that, go for it 💪.
- **Choose what you think will impress us**: This is about passion. Pick the project that excites you the most. We're looking for talent and enthusiasm ❤️.

## Basic Requirements

To make our lives a bit easier while reviewing your challenge, it would be amazing if you could:

- **Ensure we can build it**: Even if it's unfinished, we should always commit working code. Make sure it displays logs or empty spaces without crashing or rebooting our smart cat feeder (🐈😻). List everything needed to build your project.
- **User the best tools** : Tu as utilisé ChatGPT ou CoPilot? Correct. It's 2024. 💪🏻 Explain how you use those, what you changed and why...
- **Show your best work**: Actions speak louder than words! We want to see what you **do** day-to-day. Make sure your submission meets your usual standards 😉.
- **Submit your result as a PR**: Yup, on GitHub, ideally with witty commit messages. Place your answer in its own directory, and avoid deleting other challenge folders! We <u>will</u> reject it eventually, but don't panic! It means we've made a decision and want to keep our repo clean for the next candidates. Your submission will always be remembered, especially if it's good.
- **Share your journey**: We want to see how you split your work and chunk it for easy collaboration and review. Please, do not squash your branch when sending the PR. We want to see it all, even if you're not super proud of it! Reorganize your commits if that's your style.
- **Test your submission**: Put yourself in our shoes. Double-check everything. Clone the repo under a different name locally and ensure it builds perfectly. We will spend exactly 5 minutes trying to make it work if it doesn't. Make the best of those 5 minutes 👸🏻.
- ***<u>Have fun!</u>***: This is the most important part!

We can't wait to see what you create!

Cheers,

The Premier Health of America Tech Team 🚀
