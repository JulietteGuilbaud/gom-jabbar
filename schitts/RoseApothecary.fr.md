Absolutely, let's add some cheeky and absurd elements to the task, reflecting the unique charm and eccentricity of the Rose family and Rose Apothecary.

The challenge is that our fabulous owners, David and Patrick, sometimes have a tendency to mix up orders, especially when David is busy panicking over a wrinkle in his sweater or Patrick is serenading him.

Now, we will not miss this opportunity to outshine every boutique on the continent!

To ensure that David's artisanal soaps are not mixed up with Alexis' questionable "business ventures" and that Moira's mocktails are always perfectly crafted, we need to build a very well-made API and frontend to scale correctly.

This platform should be able to efficiently:

- Store all customer info:
  - Type of customer: out of town, in town, or part of the Rose's family
  - Their product preferences, including their favorite blend of sarcasm and sincerity
  - Their favorite scents, be it "Eau de Schitt's Creek" or "Moira's Melange"
- Store all customer orders:
  - The time at which the order was made, preferably during one of David's meltdowns
  - The product ordered, including David's artisanal soaps, Alexis' dubious essential oils, and Moira's mysteriously effective elixirs
  - The mood at the time of the order: angry, happy, overwhelmed, pregnant, moody, bored, excited, or "Alexis"
  - The number of customers in the order, including any surprise appearances by Johnny or Stevie
  - The split of the bill:
    - per group
    - per person
    - with ratios that only a true Rose family member could appreciate
- Store all available products:
  - The price, adjusted for David's ever-changing moods
  - The level of acceptable artisanal flair by David on a scale from 1 to 10
  - The last date the product was restocked, probably around the time of Moira's last dramatic exit
  - The shelf life of the product, which may vary depending on Patrick's serenades
- Store customer feedback once they've paid, which will undoubtedly include some colorful commentary

## Goals

- Demonstrate recovery from a complete crash of all instances, or just one, preferably during one of Moira's theatrical performances.
- Simulate the insertion of 10,000 customers making between 2 and 14 orders per year over a span of 2 years, assuming David doesn't have a meltdown in between.
- Optimize/find solutions for the following questions:
  - How many 8-rated artisanal products did David create in the last 6 months, how much money has been earned from those, and what were the median ratings of these products, including Alexis' dubious reviews?
  - What is the evolution of the number of wines that Patrick and David have curated alone compared to the number curated together over time, factoring in David's dramatic moments?
  - The evolution of Moira's mocktail choices compared to her reviews over time, with her unique flair for dramatics.
  - Search an out-of-town customer's name, which is likely to be mispronounced by Moira.

### Bonus/Optional

- Show some visualization tools and generated examples, including dramatic pie charts and over-the-top bar graphs.
- Pick different storage mechanisms for different parts and explain why, using David's meticulous standards.
